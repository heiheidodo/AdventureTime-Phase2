TODO: Write a brief description of your game here -- the setting,
the plot, the commands you can use, and a short summary of how
someone playing your game would win it (from start to finish).

Setting: our school and space
Plot: You are at VT in year 2113, and you find the college changed a lot that 
     there is a lab with a lot of stuff and a spaceship near drillfield as well.
     Then, you start your travel to find out if you can go back to the real 
     world which is now. You need to collect enough objects and in the specific
     location to go back.
Commands: take <item name>, drop <item name>, go, help, quit.
Win: You need to collect all the 4 skulls and daisy to win the game.
Here is a walkthrough:
  take daisy
  go east
  take mithrilskull2
  go north
  take mithrilskull1
  go west
  take mithrilskull3
  go southeast
  go north
  take mithrilskull4
  go south
  win
  

If you did any extra work beyond the requirements listed in the
project description, write about them here too.
